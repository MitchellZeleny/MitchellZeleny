- 👋 Hi, I’m @MitchellZeleny
- 👀 I’m interested in software development. Mostly in app or video game development, but am open to anything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science. I get my associates degree following Spring 2024 semester. But we are using C++, which I feel is outdated so I want to learn new languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any basic instruction set project. Need a basic understanding before I can advance my work portfolio.
- 📫 How to reach me: mitchell.g.z@outlook.com
